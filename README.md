# Welcome to the Official Git Repository of ToxicR!

## What is ToxicR? 

ToxicR is an R package that utilizes the core functionality of the US EPA's Benchmark Dose Software and the NTP's BMDexpress, which was developed in unison with researchers from the National Institute of Environmental Health. Unlike those packages, ToxicR is fully interactive and can be used to create custom analysis pipelines within the R programming environment.
