Description: Toxicology routines for analyzing dose-response data include dose-response analysis 
    and trend tests. Dose-Response methods are based upon the US EPA's benchmark dose software 3.  Methods have
    been extended to include additional functionality based on World Health Organization 
    guidelines.  It further supports the European Food Safety Authority's 
    draft guidance on model averaging. The dose-response methods and datasets used in this package are 
    described in Wheeler et al. (2019) <doi:10.1111/risa.13218>, Wheeler et al. (2020) <doi:10.1111/risa.13537>,
    and Wheeler et al. (2022) <doi:10.1002/env.2728>.  NTP routines are described in 
    Bailer and Portier (1988) <doi:10.2307/2531856>, Bieler and Williams (1993) <doi:10.2307/2532200>, 
    Williams (1971) <doi:10.2307/2528930>, and Shirley (1977) <doi:10.2307/2529789>.
