Description:  Toxicology routines for analyzing dose-response data include dose-response analysis 
    and trend tests. Dose-Response methods are based upon the US EPA's benchmark dose software 3.  Methods have
    been extended to include additional functionality based on World Health Organization 
    guidelines.  It further supports the European Food Safety Authority's 
    draft guidance on model averaging.
